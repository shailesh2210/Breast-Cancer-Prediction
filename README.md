# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

## what is Breast Cancer Prediction?
Breast cancer prediction involves utilizing data analysis, machine learning, and risk assessment models to estimate an individual's likelihood of developing breast cancer, facilitating proactive measures for early detection and intervention.

## Goal of this project
The goal of breast cancer prediction in machine learning is to develop accurate and efficient algorithms that analyze diverse data, including genetic information and clinical parameters, to predict the likelihood of an individual developing breast cancer, enabling timely intervention and personalized healthcare.

## Data set
## This dataset has been referred from Kaggle.
## [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)

## Dataset Description
Description:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
